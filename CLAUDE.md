## Project purpose

**Portfolio demo project** showcasing an end-to-end test automation architecture built from scratch using **Playwright + TypeScript** against a realistic full-stack web application.

The system under test (SUT) is a [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) / Conduit clone — a Medium.com-style blog built on Next.js 14 + tRPC + Prisma + SQLite.

### Demonstration goals

1. Scalable, stable, architecturally sound E2E framework (Page Object Model, custom fixtures, typed env).
2. CI/CD with GitHub Actions — PR pipeline for fast feedback + nightly cross-browser regression.
3. Secrets and env management — `.env` locally, `secrets.*` on GitHub.
4. Advanced reporting — Allure for stakeholders + Playwright Trace Viewer for debugging.
5. Best practices: typed semantic selectors, storage-state auth, DB seeding/cleanup via Prisma helpers, flake-resistant waits.

---

## Tech stack

### Application (do NOT modify during framework work unless explicitly requested)

- **Next.js 14** (pages router)
- **tRPC** + `trpc-openapi` (adds a REST layer over tRPC for OpenAPI exposure)
- **Prisma ORM** + **SQLite** (file-based DB, zero external infrastructure)
- **JWT** auth — token stored in `localStorage` under key `token`
- **TypeScript** strict mode, **Tailwind CSS**

### Test framework

- **Playwright 1.59** + **TypeScript**
- **Allure** reporter (`allure-playwright` + `allure-commandline`) — *planned for M4.2; npm scripts and CI steps are scaffolded but the reporter package is not yet installed*
- **Playwright Trace Viewer** (built-in, trace on first retry)
- **GitHub Actions** — PR pipeline (Chromium) + nightly regression (all browsers)
- **dotenv** + **zod** for typed, validated env loading
- **shx** for cross-platform npm scripts

## Repository conventions

### Package manager

**npm** (not pnpm, not yarn). `package-lock.json` is committed.

### Code style

- **ESLint + Prettier** configured for the app. Tests follow the same config.
- **Strict TypeScript** — no `any` without an explanatory comment.
- **Selectors**: prefer `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByPlaceholder`, `getByTestId` over CSS/XPath.
- **Comments**: verbose block comments explaining **why**, not just **what** — this is a learning/demo project.

### Naming

- Spec files: `<feature>.spec.ts` (e.g. `auth.spec.ts`, `articles.spec.ts`).
- Page classes: `PascalCase` + `Page` suffix (`LoginPage`, `ArticlePage`).
- Custom fixtures: `camelCase` in `test-fixtures.ts`.
- JSON fixtures: `camelCase` filenames.
- Tags in tests: `@tagname` in test title (e.g. `@smoke`, `@auth`, `@articles`, `@profile`).
- Parallel worker prefix: all unique test data includes `_w${testInfo.parallelIndex}` suffix (e.g. `test-article-1778572618767_w1`). In logs, `_w0`, `_w1`, `_w2`... identify which worker created each resource — useful for debugging parallel runs.

### Test architecture

- **Helpers** (`tests/helpers/`) — low-level functions (DB operations, API calls, env). No Playwright dependency.
- **Fixtures** (`tests/fixtures/test-fixtures.ts`) — high-level Playwright fixtures that use helpers. Manage lifecycle (setup before test, teardown after).
- **Page Objects** (`tests/pages/`) — one class per page, receives `page: Page` via constructor. All inherit from `BasePage`.
- **Specs** (`tests/e2e/`) — test files that import fixtures and Page Objects.
- **Data** (`tests/fixtures/data/`) — JSON test data, typed via `types.ts`.
- **Two article creation strategies**: `createArticleViaUI` helper is used ONLY in the test that verifies the UI creation flow; all other tests where an article is a precondition use the `seededArticle` fixture (API-based, faster, parallel-safe).

### Auth strategy

- `globalSetup` logs in pre-seeded user (`jake@jake.jake`) via tRPC API → saves storageState to `tests/auth/.storage-state.json`.
- `authedPage` fixture loads storageState → page starts logged in as the pre-seeded user.
- `testUser` fixture creates a unique user in DB via Prisma → provides to test → deletes after.
- `authedTestUserPage` depends on `testUser`: logs in as that user via API, injects JWT into `localStorage` via a fresh browser context. Used by tests that mutate user-specific state (profile updates) without polluting the pre-seeded user.
- `seededArticle` creates an article via tRPC API as the pre-seeded user → provides slug/title/description/body to test → deletes after.
- `profileUpdate` provides unique profile data (username/email/bio/password) per test → parallel-safe via `Date.now() + testInfo.parallelIndex`. Stateless — no cleanup needed.
- All cleanup fixtures wrap `use()` in `try/finally` so teardown runs even when the test throws.
- Tests that don't need auth use plain `page` (no storageState).

### Database strategy

- `base.sqlite` — seed data, committed, never modified.
- `database.sqlite` — dev DB for `npm run dev`, created by `npm install`.
- `test.sqlite` — test DB, reset from `base.sqlite` in `globalSetup` before every run.
- All test helpers use `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, never `DATABASE_URL`.

## Environment variables

Defined in `.env.example`, validated by `tests/helpers/env.ts` via zod:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | App database | `file:./database.sqlite` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing key | `some-super-secret-string` |
| `BASE_URL` | App URL for tests | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Test database | `file:./test.sqlite` |
| `TEST_USER_EMAIL` | Pre-seeded user email | `jake@jake.jake` |
| `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` | Pre-seeded user password | `jakejake` |
| `TEST_USER_USERNAME` | Pre-seeded user username | `globalTestUser` |

New variables must be added to: `.env.example` + `tests/helpers/env.ts` + GitHub Secrets (if sensitive) + workflow env (if needed in CI).

## M4 plan — `tests/e2e-suite` → `dev`

Current state: 22 passing tests + 1 expected failure (`should delete article with comment` reveals a pre-existing FK constraint bug in the app — kept as a documented bug-revealing test).

### M4.1 — Code quality pass ✅

Done. Fixtures use `try/finally` for cleanup. PO declarations unified to top-of-test in `articles.spec.ts`. `SeededArticle` interface made explicit. Dead `profileUpdate` field removed from JSON fixtures. `GLOBAL_TEST_USER` import moved to top-level. `HomePage.findArticleAcrossPages()` added to handle the paginated global feed (see "Known quirks" below).

### M4.2 — Allure reporter integration

Install `allure-playwright` + `allure-commandline`, wire reporter in `playwright.config.ts`.
The npm scripts and CI steps are already scaffolded.

Trace attachment for failed tests: add `testInfo.attach('trace', { path: traceFile })`
in the `authedPage` fixture teardown so trace.zip is embedded directly in the Allure
report next to the failed test — no digging through separate CI artifacts.

Screenshots on failure are already handled by Playwright's built-in screenshot config.

### M4.3 — CI hardening

- Make `e2e.yml` (PR pipeline, Chromium) and `nightly.yml` (all 4 browsers, 2 AM UTC)
  fully green end-to-end with Allure in place
- Docker: run tests inside a container for reproducible environments across machines
- Parallel sharding: confirm worker count optimal for CI runners
- Upload trace.zip + screenshots as GitHub Actions artifacts on failure
- Add `tsc --noEmit` (via `tsconfig.test.json` to dodge @trpc/server v10 issue)
  and `npm run lint` gates
- Multi-environment via prefixed secrets: GitHub Environments are paid for private
  repos — instead use prefixed secrets in shared space (`STAGING_JWT_SECRET`,
  `PROD_JWT_SECRET`, `STAGING_TEST_USER_EMAIL` etc.) with a `workflow_dispatch`
  `environment` input (`dev / staging / production`); workflow reads the correct
  prefix and substitutes the right secrets. Add `environment` input alongside the
  existing `grep` input in `e2e.yml`.

### M4.4 + M4.5 — Allure history + GitHub Pages publish

Combined into one PR. Auto-publish Allure HTML report to `gh-pages` branch after
every CI run — live at `Chamleck.github.io/realworld-playwright-demo`. Preserve
allure-history between runs for trend graphs (pass/fail over time, flakiness detection).
Add categories for known issues (e.g. "Foreign key bug" for the FK constraint test).

### M4.6 — Documentation polish

README with CI status badges, Playwright version badge, link to live Allure report,
architecture diagram, quick start guide, "how to evaluate" section for recruiters.

## M5 — Optional Enhancements (not planned for now)

- Multi-environment support (dev/staging via workflow_dispatch) — deferred until a second deploy target exists
- Project Dependencies as alternative to globalSetup — mention in README as an architectural alternative
- Flake stabilization analysis — after 10+ CI runs
- API tests layer alongside E2E
- Mobile viewport tests

## Known quirks / lessons learned

### `.article-preview` is overloaded by `ArticleListTabs.tsx`

The CSS class `.article-preview` is reused inside the feed component for three different states:

- The **loading-state spinner**: `<div className="article-preview"><Spinner /></div>`
- The **empty-state message**: `<div className="article-preview">No articles are here... yet.</div>`
- The **actual article cards**, rendered via `ArticleListEntry` — these are the only ones that contain an `<h1>` with the article title.

When asserting on cards or waiting for the feed to be ready, scope to `.article-preview` that has an `<h1>` inside — otherwise the spinner placeholder matches first and any subsequent `count()` / lookup runs before real articles render.

The robust pattern used by `HomePage.findArticleAcrossPages()`:

```ts
const realArticleCard = this.articlePreviews
  .filter({ has: this.page.locator('h1') })
  .first();
await realArticleCard.waitFor({ state: 'attached' });
```

### Global feed pagination with parallel workers

`seededArticle` creates one article per test that requests it. With `fullyParallel: true`
and N CPU cores, up to N+1 freshly created articles coexist during a run (N fixtures +
1–2 UI-created articles). The global feed shows 5 per page sorted by `createdAt DESC` —
so the under-test article can land on page 2+.

`should show created article in global feed` uses `HomePage.findArticleAcrossPages(title)`.

**Why not a simple forward walk (page 1 → 2 → 3 → ... → N):**
While we navigate forward, other workers finish their tests and delete their seededArticles.
Each deletion shifts our article one position backward (toward page 1). We perpetually chase
it in the wrong direction and can traverse 50+ pages without ever finding it — confirmed
in a trace where the method reached pages 50–51 without a match.

**Solution — repeated passes over pages 1–4:**
With up to ~16 parallel articles ahead at peak, our article lands at most on page 4.
The method checks pages 1, 2, 3, 4 — then repeats the full pass up to 5 times.
Even if the article shifted back to page 1 while we were on page 3, the next pass
catches it. Worst-case time: 5 passes × 4 pages × ~300 ms = ~6 s.

Navigation is URL-based (`/?offset=N`) rather than clicking pagination links — avoids
stale-locator issues when the DOM updates between page transitions.

## Notes for Claude Code

- **Follow the Page Object pattern** in `tests/pages/`. Don't put selectors in spec files.
- **Prefer semantic locators**: `page.getByRole('button', { name: /sign up/i })` over CSS selectors.
- **New env variables** → add to `.env.example` + `env.ts` zod schema + GitHub Secrets.
- **New npm scripts** → update workflow if needed in the same commit.
- **Don't touch `src/`** unless adding `data-testid` attributes.
- **Import test and expect** from `tests/fixtures/test-fixtures.ts`, not from `@playwright/test` directly.
- **Verbose comments** are welcome — this is a learning/demo project.
- **Tags**: use `@tagname` in test titles for filtering. Common tags: `@smoke`, `@auth`, `@articles`, `@profile`.
